# Nuxt 3 Minimal Starter

Look at the [Nuxt 3 documentation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/introduction) to learn more.

## About

Here is a loan application that can display a list of loan data from a [JSON file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/andreascandle/p2p_json_test/main/api/json/loans.json) containing data such as loan amount, interest rate, and term. For the loan detail page, it must provide detailed data of the selected user such as borrower details and repayment schedule. The application can do filtering, sorting and pagination and there is also a chart of loan data. The application has also implemented a responsive design to ensure that the application can be accessed via desktop and mobile devices.
